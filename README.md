# AnimalCompetition

## What This Project Is

This is a project that is designed to put two animals against each other to compete in a fight to the death. It looks at attributes of an animal, such as strength, stealth, speed, etc. to determine which animal would win in a fight.

## How To Use This Project

Load the code into a Java IDE of your choice, then press the run button. This program takes place entirely within your console. so you do not need to do anything else.

## How This Project Works

There are two modes that are in this game. The first is competition mode. This mode allows for you to face against another person to see who can made the best animal using the money that they have. The other mode is sandbox mode. You can face another person, an AI, or simply play by yourself. You doeverything by operating menus using your number keys. No numeric typing is required. 

## Further Extenstions

- Allowing for the possiblity of having more than one animal at a time
- Adding a GUI that allows for people to customize animals without having to type
- Allowing for a mode that allows users to control the fight (ala Pokemon)
